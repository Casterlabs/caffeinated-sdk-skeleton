# caffeinated-sdk-skeleton

In this repo is a skeleton project that you can copy to help get you started making cool things.

## What you need

- A good IDE, VSCode is probably the easiest but if you want to feel like a real pro you can use Eclipse.
- A Java 11 JDK, we recommend [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net).

## How to build

Open a terminal in your project's folder and run `mvnw install`. Once completed you will find a file called `ExampleProject.jar`, that's the file you add to Caffeinated.

Read the [SDK Documentation](https://casterlabs.github.io/caffeinated-sdk/Plugins%20Development/) for more information on how Widgets work and how to do other things.
